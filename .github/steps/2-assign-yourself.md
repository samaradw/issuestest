## Step 2: Adding a Label

Now that you've created an issue, let's learn how to **categorize and prioritize** it using labels!

### 🏷️ What is a Label?

Labels help you organize, sort, and quickly understand issues in a project. You can use labels to mark issues as `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, or even custom categories like `good first issue` or `high priority`.

They’re also great for automating workflows—GitHub Actions can respond to labels being added or removed!
