## Step 3: Creating and Assigning a Milestone

Now that your issue is labeled, itâ€™s time to **track progress over time** using milestones!

### ðŸ“… What is a Milestone?

A **milestone** groups issues and pull requests into a larger goal or release. Itâ€™s useful for planning sprints, managing versions, and tracking deadlines across multiple tasks.

For example, you might create a milestone called `v1.0 Launch` and assign all relevant issues to it.
