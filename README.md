## Step 1: Creating an Issue

Before diving into labels, templates, and milestones, here’s a quick reminder of what a GitHub Issue is.

### 📝 What’s an Issue?

An **Issue** is a way to track work, ask questions, report bugs, or suggest ideas. It keeps discussions and tasks organized in one place and helps your team collaborate more effectively.

2. Click **New issue**.
3. Write a clear **title** and a short **description** of what the issue is about.
4. Submit the issue.

That’s it! You’re ready to build a better workflow around it in the next steps. 🚀
